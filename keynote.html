                <p class="lead">Order-revealing encryption (ORE), due to Boldyreva, Chenette, Lee, and O'Neill (CRYPTO'09) allows for efficient order-comparison of plaintexts without decryption, enabling encrypted database applications. While very efficient constructions of ORE are known, the security achieved is uncertain and likely inadequate for many applications. A line of work has given attacks against ORE that apply in broad settings, and also new constructions that might avoid attacks if employed carefully. This will talk survey these ORE constructions and provable and empirical evaluations of their security.</p>

                <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                <p class="lead">Machine learning based solutions have been successfully employed for automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application’s manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective.</p>
                <p class="lead">In this talk, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK’s Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin.</p>

                <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                <p class="lead">Access control encryption, introduced by Damgård et al. (TCC 2016), is a cryptographic approach to minimize the trust on the sanitizer in controlling information flow. They proposed two ACE schemes for arbitrary policy. One produces ciphertexts of exponential (in the bit-length of a user identity) size, and another is from indistinguishability obfuscation. Sanitization is keyless. Their work poses two open problems: 1) to construct practically interesting ACE from noisy, post-quantum assumptions such as LWE (learning with error), 2) to design sublinear ACE scheme with practical efficiency (even for limited classes of interesting predicates). Subsequent works, including Tan et al. (AsiaPKC 2017), Fuchsbauer et al. (PKC 2017), and Kim and Wu (Asiacrypt 2017) address either of these problems in different ways. In particular, Kim and Wu left "the construction of an ACE scheme (for general policies) where the sanitizer key can be public" as an open problem. In this talk, we discuss these major works and present our general framework for building ACE, which leads to practical constructions (better) solving the open problems.</p>

Traditional approaches for protecting the data by cryptology usually fall short of fulfilling IoT security and privacy requirements. In this talk, we will introduce a trusted IoT framework enabling multiple security techniques, such as secure BLE communication, privacy-aware access control, end-device authentication, and Blockchain-based auditing. First of all, we will present several secure communication schemes for BLE-based smart objects in the IoT. In addition, a user-friendly privacy protocol for users to achieve consents with nearby BLE devices is introduced. Secondly, we will demonstrate the design of a Blockchain-connected gateway for BLE devices. Thirdly, we will give the overview of an ISO/IEC 15408-2 compliant security auditing system with Blockchain as an underlying architecture for data management.</p>

                <p class="lead">Searchable encryption (SE) is a practical cryptographic tool to build encrypted databases. Recently there has been much attention in leakage-abuse attacks against SE. To mitigate these attacks, database padding is naturally considered, because it is conceptually simple. However, the security of padding and how to effectively deploy it in practice are not fully understood. In this talk, I will summarise our recent efforts to answer the above questions. First, I will introduce information theory based methods to analyse the security of padding. Second, I will present how to design an encrypted database with padding countermeasures.</p>
